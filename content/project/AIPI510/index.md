**Course Description**  
In practice within industry, one of the main activities, and challenges, of implementing machine learning applications is collecting data to use in modeling.  This course introduces students to both the technical and non-technical (business, regulatory, ethical) aspects of collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for use in machine learning applications.  The first segment of the course will be an introduction to numerical programming focused on building skills in working with data via the Numpy and Pandas libraries, two of the most common tools used by teams working with data and modeling.  Technical aspects covered will include the types of data, methods of sourcing data via the web, APIs, and from domain-specific sensors and hardware (IoT devices), an increasingly common source of analytics data in technical industries.  The course also introduces methods and tools for evaluating the quality of data, performing basic exploratory data analysis, and pre-processing data for use in analytics.  Non-technical aspects covered include an introduction to data privacy, GDPR, regulatory issues, bias, and industry-specific concerns regarding data usage.  The course will conclude with a real-world project in which students work on a problem of their choice to extract useful insights on the problem via sourcing and analysis of multiple data sets.

**Pre-Requisites**  
Students are expected to understand the main concepts of calculus, linear algebra and probability & statistics, as well as possess a foundational level of proficiency in Python programming.  

**Learning Objectives**  
Through this course, students will be expected to:  
•	Understand the different types of data and their applications in modeling  
•	Understand the various sources for data (sensors/hardware, APIs/web, etc) and be knowledgeable in methods to collect data from each source  
•	Demonstrate skills in working with data in Python, via the Numpy and Pandas libraries  
•	Develop experience in collecting and pre-processing data for use in analytics models, via hands-on programming  
•	Be able to evaluate the usefulness of datasets for analytics purposes, including measures of quality as well as quantity  
•	Demonstrate skills in analyzing data via exploratory data analysis  
•	Build an appreciation for important regulatory and ethical considerations when sourcing data for use in AI  
•	Gain experience in the end-to-end process of sourcing data for use in AI modeling – from identifying data needs, determining potential sources, assessing legal and ethical concerns, evaluating potential sources, cleaning and pre-processing data, and performing exploratory data analysis

**Course Materials**  
•	“Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data”, by Jake VanderPlas, O'Reilly Media; 1 edition (December 10, 2016), ISBN-13: 978-1491912058, full text and code freely available at https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/.
